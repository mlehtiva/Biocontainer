title: Training Environment for Course
---


This course provides a VirtualBox image with pre-installed docker and singularity clients to facilitate your hands-on tutorials. You may use [Play-with-Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/) (PWD) which is an in-browser linux terminal for docker environment if you have problems in setting-up VirtualBox on your computer. In the later case, you need to sign in PWD with your docker ID.
